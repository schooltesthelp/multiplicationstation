# Multiplication Station
## Overview

Multiplication Station is a tool for children to learn their tables. We prioritize creating quality produts, so we created this in form as a video game, and users will get hooked on to it.

## How users play

This game is when a user tries to get coins and get the key. When they reach the key, the <i>Big Boss</i> , when the user answers a multiplication problem, needs to be solved.
