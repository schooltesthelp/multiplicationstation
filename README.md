# Multiplication Station
## Overview

Multiplication Station is a tool for children to learn their tables. We prioritize creating quality produts, so we created this in form as a video game, and users will get hooked on to it.

## How users play

This game is when a user tries to get coins and get the key. When they reach the key, the <i>Big Boss</i>, when the user answers a multiplication problem.

## Parental Controls

Parental Controls is a option to check your child's progress:

Go to https://github.com/schooltesthelp/multiplicationstation/wiki/Get-Parental-Controls

Click "```Request Access```"

It take usually 3 to 15 days for your request to be approved.
